# Decision Log

Decisions are append-only. Superseding a decision adds a new entry that names
the earlier decision and evidence; it does not rewrite history.

## D001 - Native macOS product

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: Build the primary product with SwiftUI and Swift Concurrency.

Why: the intended product is a daily Mac utility with native windowing,
keyboard access, cancellation, Keychain, Spotlight, App Intents, packaging,
and accessibility. A browser UI remains useful for references and tests but is
not the product shell.

Trade-off: Swift narrows the initial platform and requires implementing or
bridging some mature Python extraction/research components.

Review trigger: a concrete core capability cannot be delivered or distributed
reasonably through the native boundary.

## D002 - Living Research Map visual direction

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: Use the third generated concept as the canonical visual target.

Why: it makes evidence relationships, comparison criteria, uncertainty, and
learning visible without turning the product into a generic chat interface.

Artifact: `docs/design/local-lens-living-research-map.png`.

Constraint: provenance ribbons remain sparse and functional. Normal Quick
answers should not be forced into a complex map.

## D003 - Quick mode before breadth

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: The first useful release is Quick mode. Academic, News, and Deep are
subsequent milestones.

Why: daily utility, latency, installation, and citation reliability need proof
before adding research breadth.

## D004 - Exact-passage citations

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: A citation must resolve to a passage in an immutable snapshot.

Why: URL-only citations can be irrelevant, changed, ambiguous, or invented and
cannot support mechanical integrity checks.

## D005 - FTS5/BM25 baseline

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: Begin retrieval with SQLite FTS5/BM25 plus deterministic source and
diversity features.

Why: it is local, inspectable, distributable, and establishes whether an
embedding or reranking treatment is needed.

Review trigger: labelled passage-recall errors meet M004 entry criteria.

## D006 - Hypothesis-gated model work

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: No broad model bake-off. Test a candidate only against a measured
failure under the experiment record in `docs/MODEL_POLICY.md`.

Why: the project must avoid weeks of infrastructure and benchmark activity that
does not improve a runnable product.

## D007 - No Docker for normal users

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: Docker may support development or optional self-hosted services but
cannot be required by the signed application path.

Why: installation and networking complexity are major barriers in comparable
open-source research products.

## D008 - Safe adaptive UI schema

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: The model may select from trusted SwiftUI answer-block schemas but
cannot generate executable UI code or arbitrary markup.

Why: adaptive comparisons and timelines add product value while unrestricted
generative UI would weaken safety, accessibility, stability, and testing.

## D009 - Licence unresolved until public-release planning

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: Do not invent a licence during M000. Resolve repository and model
licensing before M009 publication.

Why: the intended distribution and dependency/model licences must be reviewed
together.

## D010 - Reuse the sibling research core

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: Extract the proven seams from `../deep-research-agent` behind a
versioned local protocol instead of rewriting search, safe acquisition,
extraction, retrieval, citation compilation, and evaluation in Swift.

Why: direct inspection found the needed modules and 184 unit tests. Reuse puts
effort into the native product and Evidence UI while retaining known behavior.

Constraint: the sibling has no observed `LICENSE` file. Code copying is blocked
until ownership, licensing, and provenance are explicitly resolved.

## D011 - Sibling transfer gate

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: Sibling code transfer stays blocked until `../deep-research-agent`
carries a licence file that permits redistribution. The owner applies the
licence; M001 clean-room work (schemas, fakes, fixtures, tests) proceeds
without it.

Why: audit of revision `1b1a698` found 89 commits by the sole owner and no
`LICENSE` file. Ownership is attributable, but redistribution permission is
not yet granted in writing.

Evidence: `docs/REUSE_PROVENANCE.md` records the audit, the decision, and the
checks required before the first extraction commit.

Review trigger: a sibling `LICENSE` file appears, or the sibling revision
changes.

## D012 - Frozen ResearchCore boundary and protocol v1

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: Freeze the extraction boundary, exclusions, and the versioned
protocol surface `v1` for commands, events, entities, and errors. Retain the
existing Swift WIP; its audit and the sibling test mapping are recorded in
`docs/RESEARCH_CORE_BOUNDARY.md`.

Why: M001.1 requires an explicit reuse boundary and versioned schemas before
extraction or implementation can be reviewed. Frozen wire enums must match the
Swift core and are enforced by `scripts/validate_protocol_schemas.py`.

Review trigger: any boundary change; it requires a new decision entry and a
protocol version bump.

This supersedes D009 only for the timing of sibling-code licensing: that issue
must be resolved in M001. Selection of this repository's final public licence
may still occur during public-release planning.

Review trigger: the bundled sidecar cannot meet the frozen packaging,
reliability, or performance gates.

## D011 - Evidence-Native Generative Search

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: The differentiating product contract is a typed evidence graph that
renders a safe adaptive Evidence UI. Every factual field names claims and exact
saved passages.

Why: this makes comparisons, timelines, papers, conflicts, and gaps more useful
than chat-only prose without letting generated UI bypass citation validation.

## D012 - Protocol alignment without premature dependency

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: Shape internal run events after AG-UI lifecycle/activity patterns and
Evidence UI after A2UI's declarative surface/data split. Do not depend on either
runtime in the first release.

Why: modern protocol alignment preserves an interoperability path, while a
smaller native schema is safer and easier to test.

## D013 - Recent retrieval work is conditional treatment

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: Contextual passage embeddings are the first eligible challenger for
a demonstrated document-context recall failure. Listwise reranking is eligible
only for a demonstrated ordering failure after recall is adequate.

Why: recent results are promising, but adopting them before diagnosis would
add model weight and complexity without proving product value.

## D014 - Reuse contracts, replace the execution schedule

Date: 2026-09-22

Decision: Preserve the sibling's safety, evidence, citation, and evaluator
contracts while replacing its sequential search, fetch, per-passage inference,
and uncapped assessment schedule with a mode-specific fast path.

Why: the sibling recorded a roughly 20-minute live run and identified thousands
of passages, sequential model calls, and an unenforced wall-clock limit. Quick
mode needs early narrowing, bounded cross-host concurrency, batched inference,
progressive evidence, cache reuse, and an enforced deadline.

Constraint: performance changes cannot weaken citation integrity, acquisition
safety, or typed stop reasons.
